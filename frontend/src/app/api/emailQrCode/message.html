  <p>Attached is your QR code (a PDF file). We recommend you forward this attachment to a print shop and print it with a size of A6 (or any A size).</p>
  <p>
    Every store will likely have their own way to display the QR code. One common way is to insert an A6-sized print into
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=a6+acrylic+sign+holders" target="_blank">an acrylic sign holder</a> and place it next to your cash register or PoS device.
